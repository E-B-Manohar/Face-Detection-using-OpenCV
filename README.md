# Face-Detection-using-OpenCV

## About the dataset:
391 directories containing sequence of pictures of each person. (too large to upload: ~45MB)
## Various Tasks:
1. Learnt to use OpenCV to display the image files from the dataset.
2. Coded to deal with corrupted files like zero size, unrecognised images, so.
3. Understanding how to use "haarcascade_frontalface_default", an OpenCV model that can detect facial structures in a given image.
4. Dealing with images such as conversions from color to gray, applying face classifiers.
5. Tuning parameters like image scaling, min neighbors in a detected part of face.
6. Model Performance w.r.t precision, recall, f1 score.
7. Testing the model to detect faces in an unseen random image downloaded from internet.

Output file of the detected faces in the online image: Output_54.PNG

## Next:
